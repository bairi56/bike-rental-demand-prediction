# Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## 🚴 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **demand for bike rentals** using machine learning models. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies patterns and helps forecast future rental demand. Such predictions can assist bike-sharing companies in optimizing their fleet distribution and improving customer experience.

## 📊 Features & Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, correlations, and seasonal effects in bike rentals.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new meaningful features for improved predictions.
- **Model Training**: Implementing regression-based machine learning models to predict rental demand.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R2-score).

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
